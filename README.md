# credit-risk-classification
For this assignment, we were tasked with analysing a data set with lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service company. First, we split the data into training and testing sets by using train_test_split. Then we created a linear regression model, and evaluated the model with a cofusion matrix and classification report. 
# credit risk analysis report:
  The purpose of this report is to determine whether or not the model is a strong method for determining the risk of a loan.
